# Code Style

- Functions should do one thing. If you need the word "and" to describe it, split it.
- Name variables after what they contain, functions after what they do.
- Don't abbreviate names. `getUserProfile` not `getUsrProf`. Clarity beats brevity.
- No commented-out code. Delete it. Git remembers.
- Handle errors explicitly. Don't swallow exceptions or ignore error returns.
- Keep files short. If a file is growing, extract a module or component.
- css files go next to the component they are for with the same name.
- Shared functions should go in `src/constants/utils.ts`.
